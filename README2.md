Minnesota Music Venues GUI/Database
John Underwood


The goal of my project was to create a GUI for users to enter information that 
would create a database of music venues in Minnesota ordered by name, city and user rating.
My project takes user input concerning music venues in Minnesota and lets the user enter 
the name of the venue, the city where the venue is located and rate the venue on a scale of 1-5.
The user then clicks the add button and the information is entered in to an SQL database.  
It also populates the JTextArea at the bottom of the GUI frame.  

The program was created in IntelliJ using Java and SQL Management Studio.  
When you open the project in IntelliJ all you need to do is run the program and the GUI 
automatically opens for the user to enter in information.  You can open up Management 
Studio and run a query using the MNVenues database and it will return the table and 
columns that include all the information the user has entered after hitting the add button on the GUI.

For future add-ons I would like to create a delete entry option, but not to clear the table or database.  
I would like to create a table format that populates the textarea.

Bugs or things I had not yet fixed are the confirmation screen/pane after you press the add button 
has yes, no or cancel and all of them proceed forward as though you pressed yes.  
Having just a commit and a cancel button would be preferred.  Also sizing of the GUI so it fits the title.
